```

### Create Custom Headers

This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.  Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server.

If want to User-agent change to 'dummy_name'.

``` 
curl -H "User-agent:dummy_name" https://hacking-capture.github.io
```
Send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:". This mostly used cases are website testing.
