### Create Custom Headers

This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers.  Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server.Using the -H option, existing headers can be modified or add custom named headers.

HTTP requests include information about the user agent. Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. For example user-agent change to 'dummy-name'.

``` 
curl -H "User-Agent: dummy-name" https://hacking-capture.github.io
```
Send the custom header with no-value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Custom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:". Most of these cases are used when testing websites.
