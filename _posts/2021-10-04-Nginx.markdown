Nginx, pronounced like “engine-ex”, is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.


#### Features of NGINX

Some features of Nginx are as follows:

  * Reverse proxy with caching
  * IPV6
  * Load Balancing
  * Web Sockets
  * Handling of static files, index files, and auto-indexing
  * FastCGI support with caching
  * URL rewriting and redirection

#### Installation of Ubuntu 
Before the Nginx installation,update the system.

   > sudo apt update -y

![update the system]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nginx/update.png)

 After completing the updating process,install the Nginx
 
   > sudo apt-get install nginx

  </p>
 Check nginx status 
 
   > sudo systemctl status nginx 
   
To stop your web server, type:

   > sudo systemctl stop nginx

To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

   > sudo systemctl start nginx


To stop and then start the service again, type:

   > sudo systemctl restart nginx

 ![nginx status]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nginx/nginx_status_check.png)
 
 It will show properly whether nginx installed and running

 Run localhost in curl for looking response Nginx page
 
 ![curl]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/nginx/curl_localhost.png)
