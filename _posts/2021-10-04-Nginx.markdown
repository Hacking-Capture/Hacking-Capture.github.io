Nginx, pronounced like “engine-ex”, is an open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.


#### Features of NGINX

Some features of Nginx are as follows:

  * Reverse proxy with caching
  * IPV6
  * Load Balancing
  * Web Sockets
  * Handling of static files, index files, and auto-indexing
  * FastCGI support with caching
  * URL rewriting and redirection

#### Installation of Ubuntu
