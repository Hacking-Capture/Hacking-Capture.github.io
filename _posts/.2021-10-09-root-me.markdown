### 1. Reconnaissance
 
 First, let's get information about the target
 
 > sudo nmap -sC -sV "ip"

 </p>
 
As you can see, the HTTP port is 80, the web server is apache httpd 2.4.29, and ssh is running on 22 by default.

Examine the site for possible exploitations. Check which programming is used there first. The status code for index.php is 200, while the others are 404s.

</p>
 
Check the robots.txt file on the website, but it's not there.

Here, I decided to brute-force the directory using the wfuzz tool. I guess that's better than the gobuster tool.
 
     wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u url/FUZZ --hc 404.
     
     -c	    : Output with colors. 
     -w wordlist: Specify a wordlist file (alias for -z file,wordlist).
     -u url     : Specify a URL for the request.
    --hc        : Hide status code.

 There are two directories on the website. One is the panel directory and uploads directories.

  Upload the PHP reverse shell to the panel directory.
  
Disable the ufw firewall.

  > sudo ufw disable
