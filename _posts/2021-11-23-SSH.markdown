SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. 


### How to use SSH In Ubuntu 18.04

Before the ssh installation,update the system.

> sudo apt update -y
   
> sudo apt-get install openssh-server
  
After installing SSH.

Check the status of ssh.

> sudo systemctl status ssh

To stop ssh 

> sudo systemctl stop ssh.

To disable the SSH service to start during system boot run

> sudo systemctl disable ssh.

To enable it again type:

> sudo systemctl enable ssh.

Allow ssh if the ufw is active

> sudo ufw allow ssh

### Connecting to SSH Over Internet  

> ssh {user}@{host}

For example, connect to lennie user and ip is 10.10.124.192

> ssh lennie@10.10.124.192

```
The authenticity of host '10.10.124.192 (10.10.124.192)' can't be established.ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:xXyVGVy1l27TVcjIQj2kgTTmLYN6WCB93YJB3mAHLkA.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

###  Set Up SSH Keys

Though SSH supports password-based authentication, it is generally recommended that you use SSH keys instead. SSH keys are a more secure method of logging into an SSH server, because they are not vulnerable to common brute-force password hacking attacks.

Generating an SSH key pair creates two long strings of characters: a public and a private key. The public key placed on any server, and then connect to the server using an SSH client that has access to the private key.

### Creating key pair

To create on the local machine 

> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

-t rsa : Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are “rsa1” for protocol version 1 and “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”, or “rsa” for protocol version 2.

-b 4096 : Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. The default bit number is 2048.

```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hacking-capture/.ssh/id_rsa): 
```
The default location for saving the files is the  `.ssh` directory in the home directory.

###  Creating a Passphrase

SSH-keygen will ask you for a passphrase:

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
```

The keys pairs are located in `/home/hacking-capture/.ssh/`

</p>


  $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa– contains private key.
  
  $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub – contain public key.

</p>

###  Copying the Public Key to Your Server

Use ssh-copy-id command to copy your public key file. 
For example,  $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to on our machine on the remote server/host (lennie@IP).

> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa lennie@10.10.20.255

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/ssh/read-id-rsa-pub.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Let's see if it works

> ssh lennie@ip
