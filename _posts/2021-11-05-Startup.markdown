Let's start....

#### Add to hosts file

> sudo leafpad /etc/hosts

  ```
     ip   startup.thm
  ```
file is a simple text file that associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP address.

#### Scan the host in Nmap

    sudo nmap -sC -sV startup.thm
     
    -sC is for running default scripts
    -sV is for enumerating version

</p>

From the output, we can see we have 3 ports open. FTP is running on port SSH runs on port 22, while HTTP runs on port 80. Now we know what ports are open and what services they are running.FTP login with username is anonymous and password is anonymous.

### Enumerating FTP service

> ftp startup.thm

</p>

In analyze of FTP service,  dir -a is used to list all files and folders, even the hidden ones. As we can see few files and we can read them looking at the permission on the left side, lets download them to our box.

#### Downloading files from ftp

> get notice.txt


<p align="left">

</p>

Here ftp directory check the directory for further steps.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/ftp-dir-2.png" width="350"/>
</p>

There is nothing is see that.

So we have to look to web service.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/home.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Check the robots.txt file on the website, but it's not there.

Here, I decided to brute-force the directory using the wfuzz tool.

```
 wfuzz -w /usr/share/SecLists/discovery/Webcontents/raft-large-directories.txt -u http://startup.thm/FUZZ
```

</p>

#### Checking the /files.

</p>

Well this looks interesting as this contains the files and folders from FTP service. If we have a write permission on that FTP server, we can upload a PHP script on the webserver.

#### Revisiting the FTP server 

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/ftp-per.png" width="350"/>
</p>

/ftp directory have write permission. Upload a PHP reverse shell to ftp.

#### Content of shell.php

Download 'php reverse shell'.

In php-shell script replace the IP and ports with our own ip and ports address.

<img src="/assets/img/startup/php-shell.png" width="350"/>
</p>

#### Uploading the file to the FTP Server

 > put phpshell.php 
 
<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/file-upload-ftp.png" width="350"/>
</p>

The file has been successfully written.

### Checking the webserver

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/file-uploaded-web.png" width="350"/>
</p>

The file is also reflected in the webserver.

#### Netcat listerner

Run the commands on the system

> nc -lvnp 33456

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/netcat-listerning.png" width="350"/>
</p>






> ls -la
> stty raw -echo 
> import TERM=xterm

upload linpease.sh file
