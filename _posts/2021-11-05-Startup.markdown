Let's start....

### Add to hosts file

> sudo leafpad /etc/hosts

  ```
     ip   startup.thm
  ```
file is a simple text file that associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP address.

### Scan the host in Nmap

    sudo nmap -sC -sV startup.thm
     
    -sC is for running default scripts
    -sV is for enumerating version

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/nmap-full-scan.png" width="450"/>
</p>

From the output, we can see we have 3 ports open. FTP is running on port SSH runs on port 22, while HTTP runs on port 80. Now we know what ports are open and what services they are running.FTP login with username is anonymous and password is anonymous.

### Enumerating FTP service

> ftp startup.thm

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/ftp-dir-1.png" width="350"/>
</p>

In analyze of FTP service,  dir -a is used to list all files and folders, even the hidden ones. As we can see few files and we can read them looking at the permission on the left side, lets download them to our box.

### Downloading files from ftp

> get important.jpg

> get notice.txt


<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/download-ftp-files.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Here ftp directory check the directory for further steps.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/ftp-dir-2.png" width="350"/>
</p>

There is nothing is see that.

So we have to look to web service.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/home.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Check the robots.txt file on the website, but it's not there.

Here, I decided to brute-force the directory using the wfuzz tool.

```
 wfuzz -w /usr/share/SecLists/discovery/Webcontents/raft-large-directories.txt -u http://startup.thm/FUZZ
```

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/wfuzz.png" width="350"/>
</p>

### Checking the /files.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/files-dir.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Well this looks interesting as this contains the files and folders from FTP service. If we have a write permission on that FTP server, we can upload a PHP script on the webserver.

### Revisiting the FTP server 

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/ftp-per.png" width="350"/>
</p>

/ftp directory have write permission. Upload a PHP reverse shell to ftp.

### Content of shell.php

Download <a class="link-a" href="https://www.github.com/">PHP SHELL</a>.

In php-shell script replace the IP and ports with our own ip and ports address.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/php-shell.png" width="350"/>
</p>

### Uploading the file to the FTP Server

 > put phpshell.php 
 
<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/file-upload-ftp.png" width="350"/>
</p>

The file has been successfully written.

### Checking the webserver

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/file-uploaded-web.png" width="350"/>
</p>

The file is also reflected in the webserver.

### Netcat listerner

Run the commands on the system

> nc -lvnp 33456

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/netcat-listerning.png" width="350"/>
</p>

Click on the PHP shell. Get a shell back

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/shell1.png" width="350"/>
</p>

The shell is not interactive, so it is a bit difficult to use. It lacks using arrow keys, autocompletion, and using keys like CTRL+C to kill a process. So We have to make this session a interactive session.

### Getting a proper TTY

Now lets get a proper shell with auto completion.

>   python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

Hit CRTL+z to background the current process and on local box 

> stty raw -echo

and type fg and hit enter twice and on the reverse shell export the TERM as xterm.

>  export TERM=xterm

Now we have a proper shell.

### Privilege Escalation

The first thing we can do is run scripts like linpeas or LinEnum to find out the potential privilege Escalation vectors. I personally like linpeas as it has coloring which makes life easier. As the box on THM doesnot have internet,we have to first download the script on our box, open up a python HTTP server and download on the remote box.

### Download linpeas.sh

<p align="left">

</p>

### Serving the file using HTTP server

<img src="/assets/img/startup/python-server-local.png" width="450"/>
</p>

### Downloading the file on the remote server

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/wget-linpease.png" width="350"/>
</p>

lets run the script.
 
### Interesting findings on linpeas

Three unexpected directories in root. Check the directories

```
/vagrant                                                                                                                                                                        
/incidents                                                                                                                                                                      
/lost+found                                                                                                                                                             
/data 
```

### /incidents

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/startup/dir-incidents.png" width="350"/>
</p>


A pcapng file on /incidents folder. Now to analyse the file,we have to download this file to our box and then we can use wireshark to check the content of this file. Check <a class="link-a" href="https://www.wireshark.org/#download">this</a> for downloading and installation instruction.
  
Open an HTTP server in Python on the remote box just as we did before, and download the file from our machine.
