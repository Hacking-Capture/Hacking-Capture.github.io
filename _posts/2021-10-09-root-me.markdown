 ![init]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/root-me/init.png)
   
### 1. Reconnaissance
 
 First, let's get information about the target
 
 > sudo nmap -sC -sV "ip"
 
 <p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/nmap.png" width="450"/> 
 </p>
 
As you can see, the HTTP port is 80, the web server is apache httpd 2.4.29, and ssh is running on 22 by default.

Examine the site for possible exploitations. Check which programming is used there first. The status code for index.php is 200, while the others are 404s.

</p>
 
Check the robots.txt file on the website, but it's not there.

Here, I decided to brute-force the directory using the wfuzz tool. I guess that's better than the gobuster tool.
 
     wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u url/FUZZ --hc 404.
     
     -c	    : Output with colors. 
     -w wordlist: Specify a wordlist file (alias for -z file,wordlist).
     -u url     : Specify a URL for the request.
    --hc        : Hide status code.
 
 <img src="/assets/img/root-me/wfuzz.png" width="450"/>
 
 There are two directories on the website. One is the panel directory and uploads directory.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/panel.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

In the panel directory, upload the PHP reverse shell.
  
Download the php shell in https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell.
 
Edit the code with leafpad editor.
 
In php code, change ip and port no.(preferable).

</p>
  
  It is not possible to upload a .php file.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/failed_upload.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

So, Here to bypass file upload.

Burpsuite request intercepted and sent to intruder.

 <p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/burpsuite.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

Select the payload position and payloads tab add payloads.
 
 <p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/burpsuite4.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

File Upload Bypass:

Php : .php,.php2,.php3,.php4,.php5,.php6,.php7,.phps,.pht,.phtml,.pgif,.shtml,.htaccess,.phar,.inc
 
Asp: .asp,aspx,.config,.ashx,.aspq,.axd,.cshtm,cshtml,.rem,.soap,.vbhtml,.vbhtml,.asa,.cer,.shtml

After the add payloads,click start attack.

 <p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/burpsuite2.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

After file upload successfully.


In the uploads directory, see upload files.

<p align="left">
<img src="/assets/img/root-me/uploads1.png" width="450"/> 
</p>

Disable the ufw firewall.

> sudo ufw disable

Run the nc (netcat).

> nc -lvnp 33456

and click the uploaded shell.

Got it .

Better shell for 

> python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' 

find the user.txt file 

> find / -type f -iname "user.txt" 2>/dev/null

Now to privilege escalation


Search for files with SUID permission,

> find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
