### 1. Reconnaissance
 
 First, let's get information about the target
 
 > sudo nmap -sC -sV "ip"
 
 <img src="/assets/img/root-me/nmap.png" width="450"/> 
   
As you can see, the HTTP port is 80, the web server is apache httpd 2.4.29, and ssh is running on 22 by default.
 
Check the robots.txt file on the website, but it's not there.

Here, I decided to brute-force the directory using the wfuzz tool. I guess that's better than the gobuster tool.
 
 >  wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt -u ip.

 There are two directories on the website. One is the panel directory and uploads directories.

 ### 2.Enumeration
 #### 2.Enumeration
  
  Upload the PHP reverse shell to the panel directory.
  
disable the ufw firewall.
  > sudo ufw disable
