iptables is a command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic. When a connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. If it doesn’t find one, it resorts to the default action.

# Iptables filters packets based on:

   - Tables: Tables are files that join similar actions. A table consists of several chains.
   - Chains: A chain is a string of rules. When a packet is received, iptables finds the appropriate table, then runs it through the chain of rules until it finds a match.
   - Rules: A rule is a statement that tells the system what to do with a packet. Rules can block one type of packet, or forward another type of packet. The                                             outcome, where a packet is sent, is called a target.
   - Targets: A target is a decision of what to do with a packet. Typically, this is to accept it, drop it, or reject it (which sends an error back to the sender).
